# **EmojiBattle: Auto Emoji Battle - Game Guide**

## **Objective:**

- Reduce your opponent's HP from 30 to 0 using Emoji Warriors.

## **Game Phases:**

1. **Preparation Phase (10 seconds):**

   - Players spend Wheat to summon or merge units.
   - Summoning requires Wheat, which is generated each turn.
   - Players can:
     - Summon new units
     - Upgrade existing units by merging
     - Rearrange their army
     - Plan their strategy for the upcoming battle

2. **Battle Phase (10 seconds):**
   - Units automatically attack the opponent's units based on counters.
   - Units will attack the player only if there are no opponent units on the field.
   - Units will battle each other from left to right.
   - Players cannot take any actions during this phase.
   - Combat is resolved automatically based on unit stats and abilities.

## **Actions in Each Phase:**

### Preparation Phase

- **Summoning Units:** Spend Wheat to add new units to your army.
- **Upgrading Units:** Merge two identical units of the same level to create a stronger unit.
- **Rearranging Army:** Drag and drop units to optimize their positioning.
- **Strategizing:** Analyze the opponent's army and plan your unit composition.

### Battle Phase

- **Observation:** Watch as the battle unfolds automatically.
- **Learning:** Study the effectiveness of different unit combinations and counters.
- **Planning:** Consider adjustments for the next Preparation Phase based on battle results.
- **Unit Order:** Pay attention to how units engage from left to right, as this affects combat resolution.

Remember: All active decisions and army management must be done during the Preparation Phase. The Battle Phase is hands-off, allowing you to see the results of your strategy in action. The left-to-right combat order makes unit positioning crucial during the Preparation Phase.
