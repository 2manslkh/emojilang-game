## Emojilang Guide

Emojilang is a constructed language using emojis as its primary vocabulary. Here's a brief guide to understanding and using Emojilang:

### Basic Grammar

1. Sentence Structure: Subject + Verb + Object
   Example: 👤 🍽️ 🍎 (I eat an apple)

2. Tenses:

   - Past: ⏪ (before the verb)
   - Present: No marker (default)
   - Future: ⏩ (before the verb)
     Example: 👤 ⏩ 🚶 ➡️ 🏫 (I will go to school)

3. Questions: Add ❓ at the end of the sentence
   Example: 👉 ❤️ 🍕 ❓ (Do you like pizza?)

### Common Emojis

- Pronouns: 👤 (I/Me), 👉 (You), 👨 (He/Him), 👩 (She/Her), 🔵 (It), 👥 (We/Us), 👥👥 (They/Them)
- Verbs: 🟰 (To be), 🚶 (To go), 🍽️ (To eat), ❤️ (To love)
- Modifiers: 🔝 (Big/Very), 🔽 (Small/Little)
- Negation: ❌ (Not/Don't)

### Advanced Concepts

1. Conjunctions: Use ➕ to join clauses
   Example: 👩 🗣️ ➕ 👨 👂 (She speaks and he listens)

2. Passive Voice: Use 🔄 before the verb
   Example: 🍎 🔄 🍽️ 👤 (The apple is eaten by me)

3. Conditional: Use 🎲 to indicate "if/when"
   Example: 🎲 🌧️ 👤 ⏩ 🏠 (If it rains, I will stay home)

Remember, Emojilang is flexible and context-dependent. Practice and creativity will help you become fluent in this unique language!
